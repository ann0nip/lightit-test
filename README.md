## Installation & Usage

Clone the project by running:

`git clone https://github.com/ann0nip/lightit-test.git`

When the project has downloaded to your computer, you will need to install the dependencies which you can do it by running:

`npm install`

In order to runs the app in the development mode:

`npm start`

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

In order to run tests:

`npm test`

It will launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

Optional, if you want to see the code coverage you can do it by running:

`npm run test:coverage`

## TODOs

Due to the deadline to finish this challenge, I consider these as _deliberate prudent technical debs_:

- Move the tailwind classes into separate files or as Styled components.
- Implement a flux architectural pattern using useReducer.
